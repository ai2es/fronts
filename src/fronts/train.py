    Attributes:
        loss_class_weights: Class weights applied inside the training loss, or None to supervise all
            classes (including background) equally. The reference FrontFinder model trained with
            None — zero-weighting background in the loss leaves ~95% of pixels unsupervised and
            lets predicted probabilities drift toward uniform. Metrics use
            ``data_config.class_weights`` independently of this value.
        gradient_clip_norm: Per-gradient L2-norm clip passed to the Adam optimizer, or None to
            leave gradients unclipped. Caps the damage a single outlier batch can do — one
            unclipped spike can wipe learned features and knock training into a worse basin
            it never escapes.
        loss_name: Which training loss to compile with. "fractions_skill_score" uses a
            fixed pixel-neighborhood mask (see ``fss_mask_size``); "neighborhood_brier_score"
            uses a physical-distance tolerance instead (see ``nbs_tolerance_km`` and related
            fields) and does not require label dilation to express positional slack.
        fss_mask_size: ``mask_size`` passed to ``losses.fractions_skill_score``. Only used
            when ``loss_name == "fractions_skill_score"``.
        nbs_tolerance_km: ``tolerance_km`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``.
            Only used when ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_periodic_lon: ``periodic_lon`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``.
            Only used when ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_lat_dependent_pool: ``lat_dependent_pool`` passed to
            ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``. Only used when
            ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_include_pixel: ``include_pixel`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score`` — adds
            an un-pooled, per-pixel Brier term alongside the neighborhood-pooled one. The pooled
            term alone only constrains the *neighborhood-averaged* forecast fraction, so it gives
            very little gradient pressure to sharpen any single pixel's probability once it's
            already moderately high (the marginal squared-error gain of 0.8 -> 0.99 is tiny and
            further diluted by averaging over the pooling window) — this is why pointwise
            reliability curves (see ``evaluate.obs_rel_freq_pointwise``) tend to plateau well
            below 100% forecast probability. The pixelwise term scores each pixel directly,
            undiluted by pooling, to counteract that. Only used when
            ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_pixel_weight: ``pixel_weight`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score`` — the
            pixelwise term's weight relative to the pooled term (which is fixed at 1). Only used
            when ``nbs_include_pixel`` is True.
        use_ema: Whether the optimizer tracks an exponential moving average (Polyak averaging) of
            the model's trainable weights, swapped into the model for validation, checkpointing,
            and early-stopping's best-weight snapshot via a ``SwapEMAWeights(swap_on_epoch=True)``
            callback (see ``_run``). Averaging over recent weight updates trades a small amount of
            fit-to-the-latest-batch for a flatter, less noise-sensitive optimum — cheap to enable
            since it adds no extra forward/backward passes.
        ema_momentum: Decay rate for the weight EMA (Keras default: 0.99, an ~100-step effective
            averaging window). Only used when ``use_ema`` is True.
        per_front_type_metrics: Whether to attach the per-front-type metric set (soft/hard HSS,
            CSI, POD from ``metrics.per_front_type_metrics``, plus the per-front-type loss
            decomposition from ``_per_front_type_loss_metrics``) to the finest model output. See

    """Build one loss-valued metric per front type (plus background) for reporting.

    Cost note: this builds ``n_classes`` independent ``_build_loss`` calls (one per front type
    plus background), each of which — for both ``"fractions_skill_score"`` and
    ``"neighborhood_brier_score"`` — pools the *entire* ``(batch, H, W, n_classes)`` tensor at
    full resolution before zeroing out every class but one (class weights are applied AFTER
    pooling in both losses; see ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``'s docstring on pooling
    dominating backward-pass memory). Combined with the compiled loss's own pass, that's
    ``n_classes + 1`` full-resolution poolings per batch on the finest (largest) model output.
    This is forward-only reporting cost — it adds no backward pass and does not touch gradients
    — but it is real, avoidable compute. Sharing one pooling across these independent
    ``tf.keras.metrics.Metric`` objects would require threading pooled intermediates through the
    constraint-sensitive loss path (see the REPORTING ONLY constraint in ``TrainConfig``), so
    this was deliberately deferred rather than fixed; a future maintainer profiling the training
    loop should look here first, not rediscover it via a profiler.

    Each metric rebuilds the configured training loss (the same ``_build_loss`` call used
    for the compiled ``loss=`` argument) with a one-hot ``loss_class_weights`` vector that
    isolates a single class, then wraps it in ``tf.keras.metrics.MeanMetricWrapper`` for a
    stable ``.name`` (``hss_hard`` in ``_compile`` is the existing precedent for this
    pattern). These metrics are REPORTING ONLY — none of them is the compiled ``loss=``
    argument, so none contributes a gradient or changes the optimized scalar.

    Whether the six reported values (five front types plus background) sum exactly to the
    total configured loss depends on how that loss normalizes ``class_weights``, which
    differs between the two options this project supports:

    ``neighborhood_brier_score`` (``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``) applies
    ``class_weights`` directly and unnormalized (``se *= cw`` inside its inner ``_brier``
    helper), and every term of the loss — the pooled Brier term and, when
    ``include_pixel`` is set, the pixelwise term — is a mean of ``se * cw`` over the
    spatial+class axes. That mean is linear in ``cw``: for any two weight vectors u, v and
    scalars p, q, ``loss(p*u + q*v) == p*loss(u) + q*loss(v)``, because ``cw`` only ever
    enters as a multiplicative factor before a sum. Building each per-class metric's
    one-hot vector as ``cw[c] * one_hot(c)`` (using 1.0 in place of ``cw[c]`` when
    ``loss_class_weights`` is None, matching that loss's "supervise all classes equally"
    behavior) therefore makes ``sum_c loss(cw[c] * one_hot(c)) == loss(sum_c cw[c] *
    one_hot(c)) == loss(cw)``, i.e. the per-class values sum EXACTLY to the total loss, on
    every input — including when some ``cw[c]`` is 0 (that class's reported loss is then
    exactly 0, its true contribution). This is pinned by
    ``TestPerFrontTypeLossMetrics.test_nbs_per_class_losses_sum_to_total``.

    ``fractions_skill_score`` (``losses.fractions_skill_score``) renormalizes internally
    (``relative_cw = cw / sum(cw)``, an unguarded division — a zero-sum ``cw`` divides by
    zero) and returns a RATIO of two weighted sums (``1 - MSE_n / MSE_ref``), not a
    weighted sum itself. A ratio of sums is not, in general, a sum of ratios: writing
    ``a_c`` and ``b_c`` for class c's contributions to the numerator and denominator sums,
    ``sum_c cw[c] * (a_c / b_c) != (sum_c cw[c] * a_c) / (sum_c cw[c] * b_c)`` unless every
    ``b_c`` happens to be equal. So no choice of one-hot scaling can make per-class FSS
    losses sum to the total without changing the loss itself, which the reporting-only
    constraint forbids. Every per-class FSS metric here therefore uses a plain, UNSCALED
    one-hot vector (weight 1.0, regardless of that class's configured weight): this avoids
    the zero-sum-``cw`` NaN (a one-hot vector always sums to 1, never 0) and yields each
    class's own, self-normalized FSS loss ``a_c / b_c``, i.e. the FSS loss computed as if
    only that class existed. The weaker property that DOES hold: writing the total as
    ``sum_c lambda_c * (a_c / b_c)`` with ``lambda_c = (relative_cw[c] * b_c) / sum(relative_cw
    * b)`` (a valid convex combination — ``lambda_c >= 0`` and ``sum_c lambda_c == 1``,
    since both ``relative_cw`` and each ``b_c`` are non-negative), the total FSS loss is
    always a data-dependent weighted average of the reported per-class FSS losses, and so
    always lies between their min and max: ``min_c loss_c <= total_loss <= max_c loss_c``.
