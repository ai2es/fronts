    """Training-specific hyperparameters.

    Attributes:
        loss_class_weights: Class weights applied inside the training loss, or None to supervise all
            classes (including background) equally. The reference FrontFinder model trained with
            None — zero-weighting background in the loss leaves ~95% of pixels unsupervised and
            lets predicted probabilities drift toward uniform. Metrics use
            ``data_config.class_weights`` independently of this value.
        gradient_clip_norm: Per-gradient L2-norm clip passed to the Adam optimizer, or None to
            leave gradients unclipped. Caps the damage a single outlier batch can do — one
            unclipped spike can wipe learned features and knock training into a worse basin
            it never escapes.
        loss_name: Which training loss to compile with. "fractions_skill_score" uses a
            fixed pixel-neighborhood mask (see ``fss_mask_size``); "neighborhood_brier_score"
            uses a physical-distance tolerance instead (see ``nbs_tolerance_km`` and related
            fields) and does not require label dilation to express positional slack.
        fss_mask_size: ``mask_size`` passed to ``losses.fractions_skill_score``. Only used
            when ``loss_name == "fractions_skill_score"``.
        nbs_tolerance_km: ``tolerance_km`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``.
            Only used when ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_periodic_lon: ``periodic_lon`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``.
            Only used when ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_lat_dependent_pool: ``lat_dependent_pool`` passed to
            ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score``. Only used when
            ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_include_pixel: ``include_pixel`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score`` — adds
            an un-pooled, per-pixel Brier term alongside the neighborhood-pooled one. The pooled
            term alone only constrains the *neighborhood-averaged* forecast fraction, so it gives
            very little gradient pressure to sharpen any single pixel's probability once it's
            already moderately high (the marginal squared-error gain of 0.8 -> 0.99 is tiny and
            further diluted by averaging over the pooling window) — this is why pointwise
            reliability curves (see ``evaluate.obs_rel_freq_pointwise``) tend to plateau well
            below 100% forecast probability. The pixelwise term scores each pixel directly,
            undiluted by pooling, to counteract that. Only used when
            ``loss_name == "neighborhood_brier_score"``.
        nbs_pixel_weight: ``pixel_weight`` passed to ``losses.neighborhood_brier_score`` — the
            pixelwise term's weight relative to the pooled term (which is fixed at 1). Only used
            when ``nbs_include_pixel`` is True.
        use_ema: Whether the optimizer tracks an exponential moving average (Polyak averaging) of
            the model's trainable weights, swapped into the model for validation, checkpointing,
            and early-stopping's best-weight snapshot via a ``SwapEMAWeights(swap_on_epoch=True)``
            callback (see ``_run``). Averaging over recent weight updates trades a small amount of
            fit-to-the-latest-batch for a flatter, less noise-sensitive optimum — cheap to enable
            since it adds no extra forward/backward passes.
        ema_momentum: Decay rate for the weight EMA (Keras default: 0.99, an ~100-step effective
            averaging window). Only used when ``use_ema`` is True.
